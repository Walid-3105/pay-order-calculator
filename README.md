# ðŸ“± Pay Order Calculator

A simple and efficient web application designed for use in Sub-Registrar Offices to calculate Pay Order amounts with and without tax.  
I work part-time at a Sub-Registrar Office, where manually calculating Pay Orders was time-consuming.  
To make the process faster and easier, I built this application.  
Built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and powered as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** for installation on mobile and desktop devices.
